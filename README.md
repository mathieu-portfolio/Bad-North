## Overview
**Bad North** is a Unity-based sandbox project designed to experiment with **troop movement mechanics**  
in a handcrafted map. This project serves as an introductory Unity experiment and was one of my first Unity projects.

Another Unity project explores **Bad North procedural map generation**.
